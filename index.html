  <h2>Welcome</h2>

<div class="home-text">
<p>
I am Dr. Marios-Petros Kitsaras and I currently work as a researcher in theoretical chemistry at the
CNRS in Toulouse, France.
</p>

<p>
My academic training began with a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from the
National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. I subsequently moved to
Germany to pursue a Master’s degree in Chemistry at the Free University of
Berlin, supported by a DAAD scholarship.
</p>

<p>
I completed my Ph.D. at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz under the supervision
of Prof. Dr. Jürgen Gauss and Prof. Dr. Stella Stopkowicz. Following my doctoral
studies, I held a postdoctoral position at Saarland University before moving to
France for my current postdoctoral appointment. Here at the CNRS in Toulouse, I work with Dr. Pierre-François Loos.
</p>

<p>
My research is focused on quantum chemistry, with a particular emphasis on
electronic-structure methods. I work on the development and application of
advanced quantum-chemical approaches to understand the properties of atoms and
molecules from first principles.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in the accurate description of complex electronic
structures for both ground and excited states. These include molecules with
open-shell character, charged species, and systems exposed to extreme
environments such as strong magnetic fields. My research aims to extend the
reliability, scope, and efficiency of electronic-structure theory in these
challenging cases.
